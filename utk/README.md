# Uni{corn|form} toolkit

The UTK tool kit aims at providing executables to generate and analyze
point set. It is originally meant to help researchers developing
sampling patterns in a numerical integration using Monte-Carlo
estimators. More precisely, it was developped with the precise
question of optimizing image synthesis via Path tracing algorithms.

The project contains a lot of uniform samplers and tools to compare
them.
